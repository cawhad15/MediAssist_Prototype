The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications. 
-------------------------------------
AnguralJS modules:
An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.
The ng-model directive can also:

Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
Bind HTML elements to HTML forms. 

Controllers always belong to a module. 

AngularJS applications usually have a data model. The data model is a collection of data available for the application.
Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.

AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications.
The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.
AngularJS will invoke the controller with a $scope object.

In AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions).

The controller creates two properties (variables) in the scope (firstName and lastName).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding the Scope
If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:

View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view.
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
Then the scope is the Model.

The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.
----------------------------------------
AngularJS Filters:
AngularJS provides filters to transform data:

currency Format a number to a currency format.
date Format a date to a specified format.
filter Select a subset of items from an array.
json Format an object to a JSON string.
limitTo Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
lowercase Format a string to lower case.
number Format a number to a string.
orderBy Orders an array by an expression.
uppercase Format a string to upper case.

Adding Filters to Expressions
Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.
-------------------------------------------------------
AngularJS Services:
In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:
The $location service has methods which return information about the 
location of the current web page:

The $http Service
The $http service is one of the most common used services in AngularJS applications. The service makes a request to the server, 
and lets your application handle the response.

$interval service display the time in every second
-----------------------------------
AngularJS Ajax-$http:
$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.
AngularJS $http service makes a request to the server, and returns a response.
